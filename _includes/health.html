                (More text needed) Having thousands and thousands of trees standing around in a harsh, urban environment like NYC, makes
                you wonder what will happen to them and their surroundings, since they are dynamic, living organisms that
                develop over time. Just as humans, trees can get sick and die. They can fall over, into power lines and phone
                lines, onto roads etc. They can also be a nuisance for the people living near them if they start looking
                old or sick. <br> Because of this, there can be value gained from knowing the health status
                of the trees around the city. Below is a plot of the health status of the top 20 species. It is worth noting,
                however, that the dataset is based on a community survey, the data is collected by volunteers, so the basis
                for the trees' health is solely based on perception of the volunteers collecting the data. The plot shows
                the top 20 trees and their health, in descending order of 'Good' trees.

                As we can see, there's quite a lot more trees in good health than there are trees in bad health. To get the percentage of
                good, fair and poor trees, and to further visualize the total amount of the trees' respective health status,
                here's a pie:

                GPS location. For details about the classifications, please view the iPython Explainer Notebook, that can
                be downloaded from the top of the page.
